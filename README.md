### Amazon
At Amazon, I initially worked to develop secure, highly-available systems for Amazonians to establish trust with internal tools & services. After moving to the FinTech org and joining the LYRA (Lidquidity, Risk, and Applied ML) team, I'm working with AWS Glue, LakeFormation, SageMaker and more to build intelligence into the Amazon treasury, Amazon claims management, and beyond.

### Research
In my research at Duke and MGH, I've stained brains <img width="50" alt="stain" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15662e0c-290f-4a9b-8a13-1e040e26067b" />

### Appccessibility Shox
As founder of [Appccessibility Shox](https://github.com/Appccessibility-Shox), I code open-source apps extensions for desktop & iPad like [Keys](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keys-for-safari/id1494642810), [Focus](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-for-youtube/id1514703160?mt=12), [Transcript Reader](https://apps.apple.com/sv/app/transcript-reader/id1595490573), [Vocabulary Log](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vocabulary-log/id1556420310?mt=12), & more. And thanks to AppShox's amazing customers, we've donated many thousands of dollars for the Durham Nursing and Rehab Center.
